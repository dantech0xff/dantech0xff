## About Me

```json
{
  "name": "Dan Tran",
  "based_in": "Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",
  "what_i_do": "Build Android apps that scale. Teach others to profit from theirs.",
  "tech": ["Kotlin", "Node.js", "GCP", "AWS"],
  "side_quest": "Marathon runner chasing PRs (personal records, not pull requests)",
  "scale": "Apps I've shipped → millions of active users",
  "teaching_at": "dantech.academy"
}
```

I build Android apps that don't break when they scale.

Then I teach developers how to turn their code into cash—because writing great apps is half the game. Monetizing them is the other half.

When I'm not coding or teaching, I'm running marathons. Same mindset: start, push through the hard miles, finish strong.

## 💸 You Can Code. Can You Monetize?

Most devs ship apps that make **$0**.

I teach you the frameworks, strategies, and business models<br/>that turned my apps into profitable products used by millions.

**Build it. Launch it. Get paid for it.**
